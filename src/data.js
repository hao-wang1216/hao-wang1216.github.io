  `I am currently an undergraduate student at Dalian Maritime University.
   During my undergraduate studies, I have primarily carried out research
   training under the guidance of
   <a href="https://ist.dlmu.edu.cn/info/1287/7408.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Jiqing Zhang</a>.
   My current research interest lies in enabling robots to perceive, understand, and interact with the real world, and ultimately make intelligent decisions. 
   Toward this goal, I am particularly interested in image processing and multimodal learning.
